# I Hate About Us

Yes, I said it.  I don’t like **About Me** sections.  But I have accomplished a lot.  My first *real* job was at Six Flags Over Georgia.  After a few weeks, a girl, Mignon Thompson, encouraged me.  I don’t remember whether she was the **Lead Red Tag** at the Cotton Candy stand or just a **Red Tag**.  Anyway, I moved up to be Lead Red Tag of Dixie Dog.  I must have been good.  I was recognized out of hundreds of employees.  Yet there are times where I don’t feel special.

## McDonalds

The Golden Arches was a starting place for many young folk.  I quit Six Flags to be a swing manager at McDonalds.  First at the Northside Drive store, then on to the Lenox Square store.  Again, the owner and managers felt I was good enough to manage what had to be one of the elite McDonalds in Atlanta.  Hell, I was special.  **Hell, I am special**.

## C&S (Citizens and Southern National Bank)

I tell everyone I was to preverbal mailroom to manager stories.  I climbed to AVP at Bank of America.  I managed a group of Treasury Management Implementation Specialist.  Again, I was selected, rather earned a top spot out of **thousands** of BofA employees.  **Hell, I am special**.
