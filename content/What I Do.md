### What I Do

I work at a financial institution.  My job is manager of electronic services.  I work with a team that supports our online banking site.  We help with logon problems, navigating the website, resolving issues with bill pay and person to person payments. I really like my job.  I have been in the FI industry for more than 30 years.  So I know banking and tech.
