          <h2>About this page</h2>
          <p>Yes, I said it. I don’t like <strong>About Me</strong> sections but here goes. My first <em>real</em> job was at Six Flags Over Georgia. After a few weeks I distinguished myself as a hard worker. The <strong>Red Tags and Blue Tags</strong> noticed and eventually promoted me to <strong>Red Tag</strong> at the Cotton Candy stand. I eventually was promoted to a <strong>Lead Red Tag</strong> position as manager of the Dixie Dog Hot Dog stand.  As I think back to that experience, I don't know if I realized it but that stand was really the first restaurant visitors say after entering the park.</p><br />

<h3 id="mcdonalds">McDonalds</h3>

<p>The Golden Arches was and still is a starting place for many young people. I quit Six Flags to be a swing manager at McDonalds. I started at the Northside Drive McDonalds store in Atlanta. Next I was transfered to the Lenox Square store, one of the elite McDonalds in Atlanta. <strong>I learned a lot.</strong>.</p><br />

<h3 id="cscitizensandsouthernnationalbank">C&amp;S (Citizens and Southern National Bank)</h3>

<p>I tell everyone I was to preverbal mailroom to manager stories. I was eventually promoted to AVP at Bank of America. My position was manager, Treasury Management Implementation Specialist.</p>
